# Quaver Ranking Criteria

In order to get a mapset ranked, it must follow the ranking criteria listed below. In the event of it breaking the criteria you may be asked to modify your mapset.

The ranking criteria is divided into rules and guidelines.

- **Rules that may not be broken under any circumstances.**
- **Guidelines may be ignored with good reason.** While guidelines tend to be suggestions they usually result in a better map quality. 

If you're looking for the steps of getting a mapset ranked, see: [Quaver Ranking Process](/docs/Ranking/Process).

# Metadata

## General

### Rules

- **The `Song Title`, `Artist Name`, `Tags`, `Source` and `Creator Username` fields must be identical across all difficulties**
- **The `Song Title`, `Artist Name` and `Source` fields must be romanized.** Non-romanized metadata can be added to tags. Loan words from other languages should use the original words instead of attempted romanization, so long they are part of the latin alphabet.
- **The `Song Title`, `Artist Name`, `Source` and `Creator Username` must not repeat in tags.** Only exception being in cases where these appear in relevant tags, such as the song genre. 

### Guidelines

- **When multiple metadata options are available:**
  - Aim to match Ranked mapsets. Follow what is recent and common, and verify that metadata is correct and fix it as needed.
  - Official romanizations/translations are preferred.

## Standardization

**The following metadata rules are put in place to create consistency within the ranked section.**

### Markers

- Any form of `vs.`, `VS`, etc. indicating collaboration between artists should be formatted as `vs.`.
- Any form of `feat.`, `ft.`, etc. indicating a featured artist should be formatted as `feat.`.
- Any form of `4K` or `7K` to denote the gamemode of the difficulty should always be formatted as such, and not `4k` or `7k` for example.
- If a voice actor is performing a song in character the artist should be listed as `Character (CV: Voice Actor)`
- If the specific version of a song is used in a TV program, series, or similar media as an opening/ending song, the `(TV Size)` marker must be used at the end of the title. If the title contains a similar marker by default, it should be replaced with `(TV Size)`.
- If a song title contains short version or game version markers by default, they must be replaced with `(Short Ver.)` and `(Game Ver.)` respectively.
- Unofficial cut versions of songs must use `(Cut Ver.)` at the end of the title. If the title contains a length marker by default, it should be replaced with `(Cut Ver.)`. This rule does not apply to songs that are shortened in ways that nearly match their original versions or songs that consist of a full loop from a looping track.
- If a song has been edited to have higher tempo, `(Sped Up Ver.)` marker must be used at the end of the title. If the title contains a similar marker by default, it should be replaced with `(Sped Up Ver.)`.
- If a song has been edited to have lower tempo, `(Slowed Down Ver.)` marker must be used at the end of the title. If the title contains a similar marker by default, it should be replaced with `(Slowed Down Ver.)`.
- Charts of full albums must include `(Full Album)` at the end of the title.

### Symbols

- **Special symbols in the `Song Title`, `Artist Name` and `Source` fields must be changed to their nearest ASCII printable equivalent or removed.**

    | Symbol | Recommended Romanization |
  | :-- | :-- |
  | `★ ☆ ⚝ ✪ ✻`, and similar shapes | `*` |
  | `♥ ♡` and similar hearts | `<3` |
  | `「 」『 』` | `""` |
  | `…` | `...` |
  | `。` | `.` |
  | `→` and similar arrows | `->` or `-->` |
  | `←` and similar arrows | `<-` or `<--` |
  | `《》` | `< >`, `<< >>`, or `""` |
  | `【】` | `""`, `()` or `[]` |
  | `≠` | `=/=` or `!=` |
  | `・` | `.`, `,` or ` ` |
  | `×` | `x` |

### Allowances

- **Alternative casing for markers may be used if it is stylised to the original formatting.**
- **Live performances may use a special marker, such as `(Live Ver.)`.**
    	 
## Artist

### Rules

- **The artist must be absolutely correct.**
- **Do not use fictional character names or programs as the sole artist on a track.** Exceptions are if the name is the artist's own alias.
   - **If there is no known human artist, `Unknown Artist` must be used.**
- **Use a trailing space for markers like `vs.` and `feat.`.** If a word comes before the marker, a leading space must also be used.

### Allowances

- **When multiple artists are involved on a track without clear formatting, you may use any of the following allowances to combine them in the artist field:**
  - `Composer(s) feat. Singer(s)`
  - **If there are a large amount of artists on a track without an official group name available, a descriptive artist label may be used instead.** If no fitting name can be found, `Various Artists` may be used instead.
    	  
## Title

### Rules

- **The title must be absolutely correct.**
- **When a track is made of two or more songs you must do either one of the following:**
   - List the titles clearly with a dividing symbol in-between, such as `,`, `&`, `x`, `/`, etc.
   - Create a custom title descriptive of the track contents, such as `Flamingo's Original Songs Compilation` for a song compilation of tracks by Flamingo.  

## Source

### Rules

- **The source field must be used if the song is directly from a media or event**. This includes but is not limited to `Video game`, `Album`, `Series`, `Contest`, etc.
- **Remixes, arrangements, covers etc. that are based on another song should use their own source and put the original song's source in tags.**
- **Song compilations, medleys and other pieces of media with multiple songs without a common source should have the sources put in the tags.** This rule does not apply if the piece of media is linked to a source itself, such as an album.
- **Only one source may be used in the source field.**

## Tags

### Rules

- **Tags must be related to the chart.** Misleading tags must be avoided.
- **The tags must contain the genre of the song.** For example `Electronic`, `Classical` etc.
- **The tags must contain the language of the song.** For example, `English`, `Instrumental` etc.
  - If the genre and language of the song are not obvious, include as many as applicable. 
- **Major collaborators must be added to the tags.** This includes guest difficulty makers and SV makers.
- **Maps that include the usage of any Scroll Velocity are required to have "SV" in the tags.**
- **The tags must be comma-separated with a trailing space.** This is to ensure that tags consisting of multiple words can be easily distinguished.

### Guidelines

- **Remixes, arrangements and mashups should tag both the original and current song genre's.**
- **Further tags to include are:**
  - **Unused artist, title, or source metadata not used in the fields due to multiple options existing.**
  - **Other artist or contributers related to the track not already listed.** For example, lyricist, guitarist, composer, etc.
  - **Commonly found patterns and styles in the chart**
  - **Alternative spellings of difficult-to-write phrases in the metadata.**
     - `don't`, `you're` and similar would be added to the tags as `dont`, `youre`.
     - `l1f3` , `m0n3y` and similar would be added to the tags as `life`, `money`. 

## Difficulty Name

### Rules

- **The difficulty name should be kept appropriate for people aged 13+.**
- **If a mapset contains two game modes, each difficulty must be prefaced with either `4K` or `7K`.** For example, `7K Easy`.
- **Guest difficulty creators must be credited in the difficulty title of their respective difficulty.** For example, `Flamingo's Hard`.
   - In case of multi-mode guest difficulties. Guest creators come before keymode markings.
   - Collaborative difficulties may be marked by using a combination of both the mappers names, both the mappers names with an appropriate dividing word or marker, a descriptive word, or simply `Collab`.  
- **If the mapset is a spread, the difficulty names should show a clear difficulty progression.**
   - When using non standard difficulty naming the standard difficulty name may be added with a clear dividing marker, such as `| Difficulty` or `(Difficulty)` at the end of the difficulty title.
- **Mapsets using more than 1 skillset across the difficulties must have a clear description of the skillset in the difficulty name.** Examples of this would be `Jumpinghoop (Chordjack)` or `Rollercoaster (Jumpstream)` 
 
### Guidelines

- **A custom difficulty name should be kept at a reasonable length**, around 20-30 characters is the regular upper bound.
- **A custom difficulty name should be kept related to the mapset.**
- **Avoid non-alphanumeric unicode characters in a difficulty's name.**

# Media

## General

### Rules

- **The total file size of the mapset must not exceed 100 MB.**
- **A mapset cannot contain any unused files.**
- **Difficulties containing repetitive cases of rapidly flashing notes must contain an epilepsy warning in the description of the mapset.**
- **All media used should be of reasonable quality.**
- **Any media featuring or created by a program (such as AI), should explicitly state how and where it was involved in the description of the mapset.** 

### Guidelines

- **Borderline-explicit content (including but not limited to graphic or sexually appealing content) should not be used for any visual media.**
- **Visual media used in a mapset is adviced to have some form of relevancy to the songs feel, theme or origin.**

## Background

### Rules

- **Every map in the mapset must have a background image.** Using different background images for different maps is acceptable.
- **The resolution of a background image must be at least 1280x720 and at most 2560x1440.**
- **The file size of a background image must not exceed 4 MB.**
- **The background must be appropriate for players of 13+ years old and should not contain explicit content.**
  
## Banner

A mapset is not required to have a banner image. These rules apply in case the mapset contains a banner image.

### Rules

- **The resolution of a banner image must be at least 421x82 and at most 1263x246.** This resolution also represents the default size and aspect ratio.
- **The file size of a banner image must not exceed 2 MB.**
- **The banner must be appropriate for players of 13+ years old and should not contain explicit content.**

## Audio

### Rules

- **The mapset must contain only one main audio file.** Keysounds are excluded from this rule.
- **MP3 is the only allowed audio file format.**
- **The maximum bitrate allowed for MP3 files is 192kbps.** This is to keep file size in check.
- **The audio file should be the best possible available quality.**

### Guidelines

- **The audio must be appropriate for players of all ages and should not include content that is offensive just for the sake of being offensive.** Minor explicit songs may still be ranked when marked as explicit.

# Maps

## General

### Rules

- **Autoplay must be able to achieve a 100% (X-Grade) score on every difficulty.**
- **No difficulty may have any overlapping notes.**
- **More than 75% of the length of the song must have notes to play on every difficulty.**
- **Each difficulty must have at least 1 note placed on every column.**
- **The draintime of each difficulty must be at least 45 seconds.**
- **Each difficulty must be timed accurately.**
  - **Each difficulty in a set must share the same timing points.** Exceptions to this rule can be made for timing line art or other visual gimmicks.
- **Scroll Velocity changes should reflect the music.**
- **The host of a mapset should have mapped an equal or more difficulties then any individual guest difficulty creator.**
- **All difficulties must have been made by a human.**
- **No difficulty should contain any unused SV points.**

### Guidelines

- **Avoid using overly long breaks (more than 30 seconds of consecutive break time).**
- **Maps should reflect the song concistently and accurately.**
  - **Notes should correlate to sounds in the music.**
  - **The intensity of the map should generally be synced with the music.**
  - **Simplification patterns may be used under certain circumstances including but not limited to:**
       - When an inappropriate difficulty spike would be made.
       - When a pattern is unreasonable to execute with perfect accuracy.
       - When the respective difficulty does not allow for it.
       - When the song can be effectively represented with a more predictable snap.
- **Maps should not maintain a similar structure/patterning for the sake of consistency if it goes against the flow of the music.**       
- **Maps with multiple BPM points should have a constant scrollspeed across them.** This can be achieved by either turning off the option "BPM Affects SV" from the editor or manually countering the scrollspeed effects created by varying BPM using SV points. This does not apply in the rare cases where the intention is to create scrollspeed effects using the song's tempo variance.
- **Collaborative Maps should have each users' sections identified with the Bookmark feature** This is to easily discern who did what in the map.



## Difficulty Spread

| Length        | Minimum Required Maps |
| ------------- | :-------------------: |
| **0:45-2:29** |           3           |
| **2:30+**     |           1           | 

### Rules

- **Each game mode is treated separately.** If you are creating a mapset for both 4 Keys and 7 Keys, you must have a difficulty spread for both game modes.
- **Mapsets under 2:30 minutes long must form a difficulty spread following the minimum required difficulties for it's length.**
    - Seperate skillsets should have their own spread or work in the spread.
      
       

## Difficulty-Specific

The following descriptions are what each difficulty should typically look like. Keep in mind that this isn't concrete, and there is room for subjectivity in individual cases. It is to serve how a map should come to feel and look. The following descriptions are crafted for a song at 180 BPM. 
QR is a suggestion to what difficulty your map is, however the patterning used is the deciding factor.

- **Beginner**
     - For players who are being exposed to rhythm games for the first time.
     - Notes are placed at most once every beat.
     - Long notes are at least 1 beat long.
     - Jumps are mostly used to emphasize really important sounds in the music.
     - Scroll Velocity changes must not be used.

- **Easy**
     - This is for players who just started grasping the game.
     - Long notes are at least 1 beat long.
     - Note density consists of mostly 1/1 with occasional 1/2.
     - 1/2 patterns are no longer then 5 notes.
     - Avoid chords with more than 2 notes.
     - Scroll Velocity changes are heavily discouraged.

- **Normal**
     - Maps at this level should typically start branching into patterns that don't undermap the song as heavily compared to Easy and Beginner.
     - Note snappings of consecutive 1/6 and above should not be used.
     - Note density consist of mostly 1/1 and 1/2. Occasional 1/4 patterning is okay.
     - Avoid using more than 5 consecutive 1/4 notes.
     - Avoid chords with more than 2 notes for 4K, avoid chords with more than 3 notes for 7K.
     - Long notes are at least 1/2 of a beat long.
     - Scroll Velocity changes are discouraged. Exception to this would be in the case of an SV spread.

- **Hard**
     - At this level, your creativity as a mapper is able to shine as there are far less restrictions than the previous difficulties.
     - Note snappings of consecutive 1/8 and higher should not be used.
     - Avoid chords during long 1/4 streams. If you use chords during 1/4 streams space them well.
     - Long notes are at least 1/4 of a beat long.
     - Avoid chords with more than 3 notes for 4K, avoid chord with more than 4 notes for 7K.
     - Scroll Velocity changes are reflective of this difficulty's position in the mapset. If this is the first SV of a spread it is recommended to keep it entry level.
 
- **Insane**
     - Players at this level will be able to handle a wide variety of patterns.
     - Avoid using any kind long lasting complicated high snap patterning.
     - Avoid using chords in the middle of 1/8 streams.
     - Scroll Velocity changes are reflective of this difficulty's position in the mapset.
       
- **Expert**
     - From this point on, the only thing holding you back would be the spread. Feel free to be creative.
