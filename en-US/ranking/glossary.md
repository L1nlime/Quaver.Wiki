# Glossary

This page will go over a lot of frequently used terms in Mapping including concepts, patterns, and colloquial terms.

It is recommended you view this page before viewing the [Ranking Criteria](/docs/Ranking/Criteria).

## General Terminology

- **Mapper/Charter**: The person who makes maps.
- **Playtesting**: A feature in the editor, allowing you to test your map at any given time.
- **Pitch Relevancy**: Notes corresponding to the melody of the song, typically higher pitch notes will end up on the rightmost columns, with lower on the left, mimicking a piano-like structure.
- **Reverse Pitch Relevancy**: Same concept as above, but inverted columns where higher pitch will be on the leftmost columns and visa versa.
- **Layering**: The concept of using specific patterns or chords assigned to different elements or instruments in a song.
- **SV**: Short for Scroll Velocity, is a change in the player's scroll speed during gameplay.
- **Technical/Technically Accurate**: Notes that will use 1 note or chord to represent 1 individual sound or instrument in a song.
- **Dump**: Dump is the concept of using more than one note to layer a sound in a song. instead of strictly placing 1 note to 1 sound, 1 vocal syllable, or 1 instrument, and
the main focus being more on the flow and how the patterns feel to play over everything else.

- Anything that you place down in a song that uses multiple notes or a pattern of multiple notes to represent 1 sound should be referred to as dumped. This is a common misconception that jumpstream and other straightforward patterns cannot be "Dump" because it is it's own category of mapping, which is not true.

## Chord Terminology
These terms originate from games such as Dance Dance Revolution, because of the physical motions required.
- **Jump**: Two Notes at once.
- **Hand**: Three notes at once.
- **Quad**: Four notes at once.

---

## Timing/Rhythm Terminology
These terms relate to the timing of notes and the timing of a song in the context of mapping.
- **BPM**: Short for Beats Per Minute, indicating the tempo of the song.
- **Measure**: A section of a map that is noted in the Editor with an assigned measure number, typically refers to everything between the 1/1 snap at the start and end of said Measure.
- **Time Signature**: Indicates the amount of beats in a measure.
- **Timing Point**: Timing points are objects you can place at any time in your map to change the BPM or time signature of the song.
- **Grace Notes/Flam Notes**: Notes that accent another note usually closely placed before or after a common snap, typically used for slightly accented or delayed sounds like an acoustic guitar or piano.

## Text Notation
Typically in discussion of patterns, numbers are used to assign notes to columns. Square brackets (**[]**) are used to indicate that the notes are placed at the same time, making a chord.

- How this would look:
  - `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` are used for individual, singular notes at different times. So `1234` would form a roll for example.
  - `[1234]` would be 4 notes at the same time in all 4 columns, making a quad.

## Pattern Terminology
There is text notation usage in this section, please read above if you're confused about any of the contents below.

- **Stream**: A continuous flow of notes at a constant speed, usually lacking in a lot of density in terms of chord usage.
  - **Jumpstream**: Same concept as streams but with added jumps within the stream.
  - **Handsteam**: Denser than jumpstreams, more frequently placed hands within the stream. 
- **Trill**: Notes alternating between 2 columns repeatedly. For example: `13131313` or `24242424`
  - **One-Handed Trill**: Notes alternating between 2 columns on the same hand repeatedly. Either `12121212` or `34343434`
  - **Jumptrill**: One handed alternating jumps repeatedly. Written as `[12][34][12][34]`
- **Jack**: Notes repeating on a single column, creating a *Jackhammer* motion while playing them. eg: `333333`
  - **Minijack**: Shorter than a regular jack. Typically 3 notes or less in length.
  - **Chordjack**: A group of chords that form jacks within them.
  - **Jumpjack**: Repeated jumps that form a jack on both columns of the jump. eg: `[12][12][34][34]`
- **Roll**: Repeated sequence over multiple columns (e.g., `1234123412341234`).
- **Anchor**: An anchor is normally a long string of notes at the same speed in a singular column, typically surrounded with other notes or patterns. That's what separates an anchor from a jack.

## SV Terminology
Tools and terms used for SV Mapping.

- **Linear**: SV increases or decreases at a constant rate.
- **Exponential**: SV increases or decreases at a rate that is proportional to the current value.
- **Teleport**: A jump forward or backwards in the timeline of notes, usually requires a very large positive or negative SV value to achieve.
- **Slowjam**: A constant SV lower than 1.0x.
- **Fastjam**: A constant SV higher than 1.0x.
- **Flicker**: Changes the visibility of on-screen notes frequently, creating a flickering effect.
- **Vibrato**: A tool to make the notes appear as if they are essentially vibrating.
